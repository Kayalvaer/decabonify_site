# <a name="summary"></a> Summary
# Decarbonify site!


![Decarbonify](static/readme-doc/index.png)

For the Code Institute fourth Milestone Project, I decided to develop a site for an upcoming startup

dealing with a offering a market-place for reduction of carbon emission solutions. The company will 

have a CRM site to cover the Blog and about page of the site. This part of the site will mostly cover 

the backend part and saving of static and media files on PostgreSQL and AWS S3.


View the live project here. [Decarbonify](https://decarbonify-site.herokuapp.com/)

Kindly test the adding and deletion of solutions by adding own solution and DO NOT DELETE THE ITEMS ALREADY ON THE DATABASE.
To test the functionality, you can use below details for admin testing:

* Username: admin2@admin.com

* Password: Lletmein123

* Email: any

Payment simulation:

* Card: 4242 4242 4242 4242 (U.S.A.)

* Date: any date in the future

* CVC/ZIP: any integers

## User Experience (UX)


* **:bookmark_tabs: Strategy Plane**

The goal is to attract potential customers to use the market place and also allow potential users to sell their products 
and Decarbonify becomes the middle man offering some of the solutions, with the hope of future expansion to offer most of the products.

The target customer will be both B2C, B2G and B2B, because of the introduction of requirements for LCA rating to trade in Europe it has become a neccessity for organisations to be aware and fighting towards acquiring zero carbon emission in our environment.

It is important that the website allows the users to search for solutions and find detailed information about the solutions. A clear structure and a modern design is also nice but mostly functionality is most important. The CRM will handle most of the advertising through the blog and alert the users of the solutions. 

Because of the time span I did not include the Blog and About page. However it can be included as a potential expansion of the project. It was important to get details of users to allow smooth communication with users their needs.

A strong brand identity to match the CRM as the site will be connected to it, is necessary and the shopping process needs to be functional and interactive.


* **:bookmark_tabs: Scope Plane**

For better interactivity the website needs to be mobile first designed and responsive to all devices.


* **:bookmark_tabs: Structure Plane**

The system should allow the user to register in order to save personal details and review their order history and edit profile details.

The possibility to complete an order without registering is available in the site especially for not complicated solutions like LCA results, or for those customers who want only a one-time solution purchase
 or simply don't want to have a personal profile on the website.

The system must allow users to search the database by entering specific words in a search box, or by just navigating the website sort list eg price, or by the given list types or just rather redirect them to the main solution categories. 

The user needs to constantly monitor the shopping wishlist status without entering the shopping bag page therefore allowing them to track their spending.

Admins can be able to access the dashboard by logging in with admin password and add products or edit them. A normal user will not be able to do such. A logged in user can also see profile history.

**Interaction design:**
* A user friendly interface to ensure usability and to encourage the user to return.
* Responsive and visible links which change on hover to provide user feedback as they navigate the site.
* Ability to pop up alerts so a user is alerted of what steps they are doing.

* **:bookmark_tabs: Information Architecture:**

* Navigation bar at the top of the page
* Responsive navigation bar - adjusting for mobile for ease of use
* Responsive images to ensure they fit within the designated spaces, no matter what device is being used or the size of the screen
* All features appropriate size and responsive for mobile and desktop viewing
* All information is appropriate and relative to the subject and not misleading or hard to find

### Design

### Colour Scheme

The colors of the site had to match [Decarbonify site](https://decarbonify.com/) theme and the owners required a softer green color with white to show cleanness.

- # Colour scheme
  The colours that are used for the start and game over screen are:
- ![#ffffff](https://via.placeholder.com/15/ffffff/000000?text=+) #ffffff (White)
- ![#28a745](https://via.placeholder.com/15/28a745/000000?text=+) #28a745 (Green)
- ![#36621b](https://via.placeholder.com/15/36621b/000000?text=+) #36621b] (Dark green)
- ![#ff4500](https://via.placeholder.com/15/ff4500/000000?text=+) #ff4500 (dark orange)


### Typography

I choosed two fonts that are modern and highly legible: 

* Poppins
* Sans Serif


### Imagery

Some images were used in the website and resized using [tinypng site](https://tinypng.com/) and all of them have a common 

background gradient of green or white colours, as a base colour and gives a different tone to the body.

I selected the products that I thought would fit well with the goals of this site.

The market image is from decarbonify and showing a sample of their market place that is still under development.



* **:computer: Skeleton Plan:**

The structure of the website is:

* Home Page

* Solutions by Category, price, rating

![Decarbonify](static/readme-doc/rendor-blocks-error.png)

### **Performance testing:**
1. Tested website responsiveness using http://www.responsinator.com/
    1. Results: The website did not load on responsinator. However I used Google dev tool responsive checker to test and all was great except the 320x568 small screen sizes. I made styling adjustments so that it fits. Most of the popular scree sizes passed well. Also asked family and friends to test.
1. Tested the image size to ensure no image is to large and impacting the website loading times. I used the Tiny.png 
    1. Results: Images were ok and resized.

1. All HTML and CSS were tested using https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator
    1. 25 errors in html validator observed.All but the templates resulted in errors from comment code and duplication of the logo-img id. This was to be expected as the logo was duplicated in the same page to allow visibility in mobile screens.
    1. It is coomon that all HTML pages show errors where the Jinja template language was used
    1. None of these are actual errors within the code
	1. 5 critical CSS errors were observed. However, the items highlighted were added intentionally to the CSS files and did create the desired affect
1. Tested the website on the popular mobile screens include apple phone and desktop and tablet.
    1. Results: The website was responsive and the elements performed in the way they were intended to

1. Tested adding items to the basket
    1. Results: Successfully able to add an item to the basket
1. Tested increasing the quantity of items in the basket
    1. Results: Successfully able to increase the quantity of an item in the basket
1. Tested removing items from the basket
    1. Results:Successfully removed an item from the basket
1. Tested the stripe process using 4242 4242 4242 4242 which should be successful
    1. Results: Order completed successfully and the confirmation page appears
1. Tested the stripe process using 4000 0027 6000 3184 which will request authorisation - completed authentication
    1. Results: Authorisation screen appears then the order completed successfully and the confirmation page appears
1. Tested the stripe process using 4000 0027 6000 3184 which will request authorisation - selected declined
    1. Results: The payment fails and the user is returned to the checkout page. The appropriate error message appears
1. Tested the profile page and that the orders placed above show correctly
	1. Results: The two successful orders made during testing appeared on the right hand side of the screen and looked good on all screens

<summary>Usability Testing </summary>

### Usability Testing

Going through the user stories, I tried to test the project with different scenarios on different devices
 (laptop and mobile phone).

#### As a customer

* I want to browse through the categories to understand if there is something I might buy:

    Opening the site, first scroll down to have a look at the home page, then go back to the top.
    Read the names of the categories in the navigation bar and  click on one of them.

    A page with all the items in that category opens, and you are able to sort the products in different ways (
        price, brand, name
    ).

* I want to add something to my shopping bag:

    Finding an item that you like, Click on it and reach the product detail page. Here one can view all
     the details, such as image, description and amount.
    There is a button that allows adding the item to the shopping bag and choosing the right size and the 
    amount needed. When adding something a toast appears on the top-right of the page, telling me that the item has been
    successfully added.

    On the top of the page there is a banner with a message, saying how many items one have inside my basket
     and how much is the grand total right now that one should pay if deciding to complete the purchase.

    There is also a count number next to the shopping bag icon inside the navbar.

    At the bottom of the page I can see a carousel with some items that I might like. If I see something interesting,
     I can click on the name of the product and I am redirected to that specific product page. From there, one can 
     repeat the process (add item to the bag, click on another item and visit its page).

# Add basket

* I want to purchase something:
     The chance to access user shopping basket in three ways: from the bag icon in the navbar, from the banner at
      the top of the page clicking on the word "bag" (which stands out from the other words, so one understand it is a link),
      or by clicking the button "View-wishlist" that appears inside the toast when adding a new product.
    
    From my shopping bag, review all the items added and you can also modify it. Change the quantity per item
     or remove the product. If deciding to update the quantity you get a toast with a message that confirms the updating, 
     but see as the price in the product row changes (it updates automatically), together with the grand total.
    If you remove something, get as well a toast with a confirmation and the product disapper from the basket. The price updates.

    When satisfied with the content in the shopping bag, I can click on the button "Secure Checkout", that brings me 
    to another page.
    Here I find a form where one can enter my details.
    If a registered user and already logged in, find my info already displayed inside the form. If no changes required leave them as they are and go on with the payment, or you can change them.
    A checkout box allows saving the information for the next time.
    If not a registered user, complete anyway the purchase. The form in this case is empty and you can fill it 
    with your details.

    Enter credit card information and the ZIP code if required. If the form is valid, the card is charged and purchase
     is completed. You then get redirected to a page with the summary of the order and a toast confirms the successfully operation.
 

# basket

# Order confirmation

* I want to register:
    
    Click on the profile icon and see the link to the "Register" page.
    You then redirected to a page with a form where you need to enter email twice, a username and a password twice.
    If something is wrong in my form (a wrong format) I am not allowed to submit and a message will be send to alert you.
    If the form is correct, it is submitted. 
    You then redirected to a page that asks you to validate your email through a link that has been automatically sent to the email address provided. Open emails and find the email from
      "Decarbonify". Click on the link and account is now verified. The "Sign In" page automatically opens and you can
       log in with my new account.
    
# Log In

# Verify email

# email-verification

* I want to add a review:

    As a registered user I can perform tasks that are not available to non registered ones. One of them is the chance to
     add a review.
    From nav menu just click on the account icon. 
    A dropdown menu with sub-links opens and select "My profile".
    From this page, click on the section "My reviews" which is inside "My activity".

* I want to log out:

    Click on the user icon and select the option "logout". To confirm if you really want to sign out, and 
    clicking on the "sign out" button you redirected to the home page, with a toast that confirms that now you signed out.

#### As an admin

* I want to add a product directly from the website:

    I log in with my credentials. Being an admin I can access functionality that is not accessible to other users.

    Click on the user icon, select "Manage Product" and you get redirected to a page where one can add a new product 
    to the database. Click on "Add Product" and if the form is valid the product is successfully added. If not,
     a message inside the forms tells you their is an error.


# add new item

* I want to update details about a product from the website:

    log in with my credentials. An admin can access functionality that is not accessible to other users.

    On every page where an item is displayed, see two options: "edit" or "delete".

    If you want to update some info, click on detail and you can now access a form. Inside each field the 
    product details are already in the database. Click on the field that you want to update, change the value, and then 
    click on the button "Update Product". If everything is correct, the form is validated and submitted.

    See a toast with a confirmation message and you redirected to the collection page.

# Edit Item

* I want to delete a product from the website:

    Log in with my credentials. Being an admin I can access functionality that is not accessible to other users.

    On every page where an item is displayed, I see two options: "edit" or "delete".

    Select "delete" and the item is automatically removed from the database. I am redirected to the collection
     page and I get a toast confirmation.

### Functionality Testing

All the <strong>links</strong> are working.

The <strong>form</strong> validation is handled by Django and it is working.

<strong>HTML</strong> has been validated with [HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org/) and everything was ok.

<strong>CSS</strong> has been validated with [CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/). 

<strong>JavaScript</strong> has been checked with [JSHint](https://jshint.com/)

For <strong>Python</strong> I used the command ```python3 -m flake8``` in my terminal to highlight all the issues in my project.
Most of the errors were too long lines and errors DJ01 ("Avoid using null=True on string-based fields").

left the ones below because they are important for the functionality:


<details>

```
./checkout/webhooks.py:28:5: F841 local variable 'e' is assigned to but never used
./checkout/webhooks.py:31:5: F841 local variable 'e' is assigned to but never used
./checkout/apps.py:8:9: F401 'checkout.signals' imported but unused
```


</details>

I successfully tested also payments using different credit cards provided by [Stripe](https://stripe.com/docs/testing#international-cards).

I checked that the payment form adapts to the credit card number:


<details>

If I enter a card that is in the U.S.A., I get the field for the ZIP code.
    
    Card Number: 4242 4242 4242 4242 | Date: any date in the future | CVC: any number | ZIP Code(example): 24242

If I enter a card that is in the U.K., I get the field for the postal code.
    
    Card Number: 4000 0082 6000 0000 | Date: any date in the future | CVC: any number | Postal Code(example): SW1W 0NY

If I enter a card that is in Australia, I don't get any additional field apart from the credit card details.
    
    Card Number: 4000 0003 6000 0006 | Date: any date in the future | CVC: any number 

I tested the authorization for the payment:

    Card number: 4000 0027 6000 3184

I tested for a invalid CVC:
     
    Card number: 4000 0000 0000 0101

I tested for insufficient founds;

    Card number: 4000 0000 0000 9995

I tested for stolen card:

    Card number: 4000 0000 0000 9979

I tested for expired card:

    Card number: 4000 0000 0000 0069

1. From the GitPod terminal, create **requirements.txt** and **Procfile** using these commands:

```console
pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt
echo web: python app.py > Procfile
```

2. **Push** these files to GitHub
3. **Log In** to [Heroku](https://id.heroku.com/login)
4. Select **Create new app** from the dropdown in the Heroku dashboard
5. Choose a unique name ('recipe-nation') for the app and the location nearest to you
6. Go to the **Deploy** tab and under **Deployment method** choose GitHub
7. In **Connect to GitHub** enter your GitHub repository details and once found, click **Connect**
8. Go to the **Settings** tab and under **Config Vars** choose **Reveal Config Vars**
9. Enter the following keys and values, which must match those in the settings.py file:

|**Key**|**Value**|
|:-----|:-----|
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID|'AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID'
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY | 'AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY'
|DATABASE_URL|'DATABASE_URL'|
|EMAIL_HOST_PASS|'EMAIL_HOST_PASS'|
|EMAIL_HOST_USER|'EMAIL_HOST_USER'|
|SECRET_KEY|'SECRET_KEY'|
|STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY|'STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY'|
|STRIPE_SECRET_KEY|'STRIPE_SECRET_KEY'|
|STRIPE_WH_SECRET|'STRIPE_WH_SECRET'|
|USE_AWS|True|

10. Go back to the **Deploy** tab and under **Automatic deploys** choose **Enable Automatic Deploys**
11. Under **Manual deploy**, select **master** and click **Deploy Branch**
12. Once the app has finished building, click **Open app** from the header row of the dashboard

Thank you to my mentor Akshat Garg for his help.

A special thanks also to the Code Institute Tutor Team, that has been always very nice helping with some issues that I faced
 during the development and when my transfer of files from Django to S3 failed for days. A big thanks to all for their patience and courtesy.

Thank you also to all that took the time to test the website.
